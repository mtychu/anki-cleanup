# Anki Cleanup Scripts

A collection of scripts I'm using to clean up and automate my Anki Deck

### OpenAI TTS & Example Sentences
Automatically fetch example sentences and audio files from Open AI and add them into Anki

### Card Merge
When adding new decks, you will often already have a lot of cards you already know. This script will scan the new cards, and transfer progress from words you already know to the new deck (or alternatively keep the old cards). This will retain all of your progress and history.
